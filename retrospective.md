What went bad:

-   Justin: Jira board slowing us down.
-   John & Abigail: Took way too long to get started, felt like the Jira board was holding us back.
-   Jessica: PO's expectations were confusing.
-   Vani: Last minute changes to the stories like adding TDD

    -   We had to get ready for presentation and we wanted to use Mockito but we didn't have much experience with it. We just didn't have enough time to incorporate it.

    Silver Lining: - The Jira board helped with structure on what was going on and what needed to be done.

What went well:

-   Abigail: We should have come up with set "work hours" so we were all up and ready to get on calls and work together at the same time
    -   There were days where we didn't get started till after our stand-up. We could've gotten further along as a team.
-   Jessica: I'm sure we could have improved as a team but this was a learning process for us all, so I don't have anything specific we NEED to improve
    -   It was a general statement.
    -   Have more targeted work schedule.
-   Abigail: I think more mob programming could have been useful, the other teams said it was amazing for them
    -   We did it a few times, our mob programming was a bit split in knowledge, some people knew what was going on and some people didn't.
    -   We would have to like mob programming more if there was a next time.

We Liked Last:

-   Great Team work in accomplishing tasks.
    -   No one had an issue picking up tasks
    -   We didn't bump heads at all
-   Cohesion within team, no butting heads, all focused on one goal
-   We all trusted each other to get the work done, and pick up tasks that we knew how to do
    -   John and Justin worked together to work on getting deleteProducts method together. They weren't sure if it was going to work but they wanted to give it a shot anyways. It was a good learning experience for them.
    -   Abigail was always willing to help especially when Jessica was having issues in the front-end, Abigail wasn't too sure of what the code was doing but she still willing to jump on a call to assist where she could.
    -   John loved working with Vani, she helped guide with the backend. He also mentioned that Abigail was a star in the backend
    -   There was a day when Vani and John worked at 5 in the morning even though John went to bed late the night before. He didn't mind because he liked working with Vani.
-   Justing: No Struggle for power for the "Lead Dev" role
-   Dylan... Just Dylan :)
    -   Dylan gushed
-   We all worked together pretty well and the transparency was nice whenever there was an issue, personal/technical.
    -   Whenever there was an issue as far as technical issues like power/internet issues members of the team made sure to communicate that and we didn't have to worry about how we were going to move forward.
